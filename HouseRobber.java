// Time Complexity : O(n) since we will have to iterate over each house to see if we want to rob it or not
// Space Complexity : O(n) since we will store the max amount of money that can be robbed until that house
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode :Yes
//Approach: if there is 1 house, you can only rob that house, if there are two, you can rob the one that has more money to offer
//if there are more than 2, then you will choose the max amount by selecting the max(amount at current + the max amount at i - 2, max amount at i - 1)
